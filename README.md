# FLW2 02.7 Code It Solo

## Coin Flipper

In this app, the user clicks a button and the coin lands on either heads or tails, and keeps track of how many times the coin has landed on each.

## Instructions

- USE COMMENTS AS CLUES! You'll find lots of comments in the Flip() component, where you'll want to write specific parts of your code. Feel free to delete the comments when you're finished, keep them up, or change them. Remember, leaving comments is another great practice!
- On lines 50-57, there is an image of a coin that changes from heads to tails depending on the state of the coinSide variable. The syntax may be unfamiliar, but it's using what's called a "ternary" expression. Essentially, it's an if/else statement but written slightly differently. These are easier to use in React (particularly when it comes to conditionally returning elements)
- You won't be passing any functions as props in this assignment! Since we're building out everything our Flip() component, we'll have everything we need.

## Bonus Challenge!

- Add a button that resets the heads & tails count back to 0 and changes the coin image back to heads. You'll need to build a function and add it as an event handler to the button.
  - Look back to the Counter app for syntax help!
